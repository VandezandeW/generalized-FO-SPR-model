This folder holds several ray tracing Monte Carlo simulation outputs (RTMCS). Each file contains the arrays of the gamma and alpha angles of the traced rays. Each angle array has two dimensions:
	-The first dimension holds the different rays, i.e., each 	ray has a row.
	-The second dimension is the concerning angle in the FO-	SPR probe before (first column) and after reflection 	(second column).
